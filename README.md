# PGP-AI-ML
# Foundations
The Foundations block comprises of two courses where we get our hands dirty with Statistics and Code, head-on. These two courses set our foundations so that we sail through the rest of the journey with minimal hindrance.

Hands-on Projects : Classifying silhouettes of vehicles
Classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicles, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. You can view the vehicle from one of many different angles. The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles from different angles. Four “Corgie” model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double-decker bus, Chevrolet van, Saab 9000, and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van, and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable. Still, it would be more challenging to distinguish between cars.

# Capstone Project
You will get your hands dirty with a real-time project under industry experts’ guidance from introducing you to Python to the introduction to artificial intelligence and machine learning and everything in between Python for AIML. Successful completion of the project will earn you a post-graduate certification in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
